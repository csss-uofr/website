          Just ask! We’re always happy to bring more people on board. Our
          organization has a three-layer reporting structure: the president, the
          other core executives, and the committees. The president and core
          executives are elected each spring, while committee members are
          appointed throughout the year. If you see a position that interests
          you, or just want to get involved, shoot us an e-mail at president
